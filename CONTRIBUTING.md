# Contribution Guidelines

## For outsiders

This repository is not intended to welcome outside contributions, yet creating a new branch out of master should be the first step before proceeding towards direct open source contribution.

Forking is allowed.
## For direct contributors

### Structure
Base structure of any webpage should not be modified. You may create your own file for something entirely new.

### Theme
Keep the color scheme intact, and actions added in pages not to be removed entirely, but can be modified for a better cause.

### Fonts
The base font is already included and can be seen in most of the text. Including a new font should be done after considering all the usage permissions and licenses regarding that particular font.

### Icons and illustrations
Do not modify or change or delete any illustration or base icon(s) in any way. They must be and should be kept same no matter how you use them. Adding new illustrations is allowed. The Schemester app icon should not be modified in any way.

### Info docs
Any informational files like README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, or any other informational doc, should NOT be modified by anyone other than the owner(s) of this repository. Any commit to these files (mostly .md ones) will be rejected.
